         <h4>Poverty<h4>
<p>The world has been trying to deal with poverty for many years, but according to the World Bank, it’s unlikely to end extreme poverty by 2030. COVID-19 was a big reason why. In 2020, 70 million people fell into extreme poverty. This number represents the largest one-year increase since 1990 when the world started monitoring global poverty. Extreme poverty, which is defined as earning less than $2.15 a day, concentrates in areas where it’s hard to address, such as rural areas, Sub-Saharan Africa, and areas with conflict. Ending poverty is complex and involves addressing other social justice issues, such as low-quality education, inferior healthcare, gender inequality, and so on.  <br><br><b>Solution</b>:adressing poverty requires a multi-dimensional approach that targets its various underlying causes.one effective solution is to enhance access to quality education a vocational training , empowering individuals with the skills needed for gainful employment.</p>

<h4>Gender-based violence<h4><p>
Gender-based violence is a global issue. According to the WHO, about 30% of women have endured physical and/or sexual violence in their lifetime. Most violence is perpetrated by an intimate partner. This type of violence affects a person’s sexual, mental, emotional, and physical health. The violence can also be fatal. Around the world, around 38% of murdered women were killed by their intimate partners. Reports, like the one released by the United States Institute of Peace, found that COVID-19 made gender-based violence worse. How can gender-based violence be addressed? It requires a multi-faceted approach. Improved gender equality, early education, better legal protections for women, and more are essential pieces of the puzzle. <br><br><b>Solution</b>: addressing gender-based violence GBV requires a comprehensive approach that includes prevention, protection, and support mechanisms. Firstly, education and awerness campaigns are essential in changing societal attitudes and norms that perpetuate GBV.</p>


<h4> Threats to the trans community<h4><p>
The LGBTQ+ community as a whole is vulnerable to violence and discrimination, but the trans community has been facing an increasing number of threats. The United States provides many disheartening examples. In Florida, the state board of medicine agreed to start the process of barring minors from receiving puberty blockers, hormone therapy, or surgeries to treat gender dysphoria. This goes against organizations like the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, and the American Academy of Pediatrics, which support gender-affirming care for young people. Meanwhile, in Keller, Texas, a school board voted to ban all books that even mention gender fluidity. Actions like this represent a concentrated effort to roll back rights for LGBTQ+ people.<br><br><b>Solution:</b>speak out in support of transgender people and transgender rights.Politely correct others if they use the wrong name or pronoun for a transgender person.More broadly,it is important to challenge anti-transgender remarks,jokes and conversations.</p>

<h4>The refugee crisis<h4><p>
According to the UN Refugee Agency, over 2 million refugees will need to be resettled in 2023. That’s a 36% increase from 2022. There are a few reasons why, including the pandemic, climate change, conflict, and more. Women and children are especially vulnerable to trafficking and violence. According to a report from Save the Children, “likely all children” migrating to Europe through the Balkans faced violence. Police and smugglers were the most common perpetrators. Both the resettlement and safety of refugees as they migrate are must-address social justice issues.<br><br><b>Solution:</b>returning back home voluntarily if the situation is safe,being resettled to a third country,especially if they are in danger or cannot return home or integrating and becoming citizens of their country of asylum.</p> 

<h4>Political extremism<h4><p>
Eroding democracy is closely linked to political extremism, which is becoming an increasingly urgent problem. On January 6th, 2021, a riot of Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol in an attempt to stop the electoral vote count. This represents a trend of overtly violent political extremism, which has included a mass shooting in Buffalo and an attack on the husband of Nancy Pelosi, the Speaker of the House. Political extremism isn’t limited to the United States. A ProPublica article published not long after the insurrection outlined a growing international network of right-wing extremists. It’s been happening for years. While the world focused on Islamic extremism following 9/11, right-wing extremism grew fairly unhindered.<br><br><b>Solution:</b>education is a powerful tool to build learners resilience to violent extremisim and mitigate the drivers of this phenomena.It helps strengthen their commitment to non-violence and peace,in particular by addressing hateful and violent narratives so the best solution is to inform people and edcuate them about the dangers of political extremism.</p>

 <h4>Cybersecurity threats<h4><p>
According to the WEF’s Global Risks Report 2022, cybersecurity vulnerabilities are a major concern. In wake of the pandemic, many economies underwent rapid digitalization. While useful, that has increased the risk of cyberattacks. 2022 saw some significant attacks, including in Costa Rica, where a cyber gang known as Conti disrupted financial operations. The Ministry of Finance was targeted, leading the country to declare a national emergency. What does this have to do with social justice? Cybersecurity is closely related to issues of privacy and safety, which are social justice issues. Who gets access to the best cybersecurity measures is also a social justice issue. As this blog post by Merritt Baer points out, cybersecurity is a wealth discrimination issue.<br><br><b>Solution:</b>Keep your software and systems fully up to date,ensure endpoint protection,install a firewall,backup your data,control access to your systems,secure your wifi networks lastly have different passwords setup for every application you use.</p>

<h4> Racism<h4><p>
Racism takes many forms, but it remains a persistent social justice issue. Throughout 2020, a wave of anti-Asian hate crimes surged around the world. An article in Time collected various statistics from places like New Zealand, which found that 54% of Chinese survey participants had experienced discrimination. In the UK, hate crimes against Chinese, East, and South East Asians rose by as much as 300% compared to data from 2018 and 2019. Racism against Black people is still prevalent, too. The National Urban League released its annual report in 2022, reporting that while Black Americans made economic and health gains, white people were still ahead in education, social justice, and civic engagement. These are just two examples of racism and why it needs to be addressed.<br><br><b>Solution:</b>Listen and educate yourself by paying attention to voices of people who experience racism every day,raise awareness and report racist content online if possible.</p>
